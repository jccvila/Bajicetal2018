This folder contians the input files needed for all COMETS simulations except those involving LTEE mutants.
The model file can be used as a template from which reactions can be deleted or added. To delete a reaction set the bounds to 0 0. To add a reaction set the bounds to the default bounds found in the default bounds file.
The model has also been included as an SBML file for  ease use with other packages (i.e COBRApy)
