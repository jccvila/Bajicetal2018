This repository contain the datafiles for Bajic et al 2018. 
Methods used to obtain this data are outlined in the SI for the paper.

The data is broken down by relevant figure. 


Fig1C.csv: Secretion Profile (output fluxes) for subset of genotypes  differing from E.coli by a single metabolic mutant
FigS1.csv: Secretion Profile for full that set of single metabolic mutant genotypes that have an environmental effect.
FigS2.csv: Fitness and environmental effect of metabolic mutants.

Fig2C.csv: Simulated fitness landscape measurments for Citrate mutants in the DM25 Medium
Fig2D.csv: Experimental fitness landscape measurments for Citrate mutants in the DM25 Medium
FigS4.csv: Experimental and predicted colony counts for all indivual competition assays.

Fig3.csv: Contains data for all pairs in the network which have an epistatic interaction, as defined in the main text (epsilon > 0.001)
FigS6.csv: Environemntal effect of all mutants which are in the network

Fig4Bcsv: Data used to calculated ΔFitness for a single random walk starting with ACKr
Fig4C.csv: Summary ΔFitness statitics for 100 random walks starting with ACKr
FigS7.csv: Summary ΔFitness statitics for 100 random walks, for 16 mutants with large Environmental effect
Fig4D.csv: Summary ΔGrowth statitics for 100 random walks + summary statics for expected ΔGrowth from the null model Starting with ACKr
FigS8.csv: Summary ΔGrowth statitics for 100 random walks + summary statics for expected ΔGrowth from the null model, for 16 mutants with large Environmental effect
FigS9_1.csv: Fitness increase at each step for example adaptive trajectory (compared to null model where lactate is removed).
FigS9_2.csv: Environment generated at each step for example adaptive trajectory

COMETS Files folder contains comets files used for simulations (see readme inside the folder for more detail).
