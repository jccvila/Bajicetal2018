This repository contain the datafiles for Bajic et al 2018. Method used to obtian this data are outlined in the SI for the paper.

Fig3.csv: Data to used to calculate noncommutative epistasic interactions (δ) for pairs of mutants where  δ/FMAX > 0.01, i.e all the mutant used in Fig 3B and 3C



Fig4B: Fitnes Measurements along a single random walk used to calculate delta fitness. 
Fig4C: Mean and SE of Delta Fitness across 100 independent random walks.
Fig4D: Mean and SE of Delta Growth Rate across 1000 independent random walks for both actual result and the null model without epistasis.
